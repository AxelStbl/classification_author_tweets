### Summary

Using machine learning tools, we have built a supervised nlp-based jokes regressor, that gets a joke in English as an input, creates various features that try to capture the sense of the joke, and predicts how funny it is, in a scale 0 to 1.

### Dataset

A reddit jokes dataset, that contains more than 180,000 jokes and their score (votes). 

Our intention is to use the scrap tweets from a pre-made list of 'funny' pages, and use the tweets to further train & test the model, in addition to some more twitter-based feature engineering.
